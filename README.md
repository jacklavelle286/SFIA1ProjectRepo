# My Interactive Study Portal For Storage Solutions in AWS

For my SFIA1 prpject as part of my learning path to become a Technology consultant with QA, I am learning how to create and manage a CRUD application. CRUD stands for the following 
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete 

As I am interested in Cloud Computing, (specifically AWS) I am going to make to a simple and interactive study guide to help student collaborate and share knowledge, links and study tips about AWS Storage services. Please let me know if you have questions regarding my application by email on lavellej286@gmail.com.
